# [CHAPTER 7] Technology parameters and timing issues
## What are integrated circuits ? PCB ? What is glue logic ? What are logic families ?
Digital circuits are constructed with integrated circuits, an integrated circuit (or chip) is a semi-conductor crystal, most of the time made of silicon containing the electronic components, gates and memory storage
Integrated circuits are connected through pins on a PCB (printed circuit board)

An integrated circuit can range from many dimensions and can count up to a few billions transistors, nowadays, chips are fabricated on wafer.
Digital integrated circuits were categorized by how many gates they contained
- **SSI** (small scale integration) containing between 1-20 gates are very rarely used now except as **glue logic** which is a type of circuitry that allows different types of chips to work together.
- **MSI** (medium scale integration) containing between 20-200 gates.
- **LSI** (large scale integration) containing 1000s of gates.
- **VLSI** (very large scale integration) containing between 10<sup>4</sup> -10<sup>9</sup> gates.

### Logic families 
Digital circuits are also classified according to families, a **logic** family is a collection of integrated circuits with similar input/output and internal circuitry. Chips from the same family can be interconnected while they may not be compatible between logic families.
The most common logic families are:
- **TTL** (transistor - transistor logic) that uses bipolar juction transistors
- **CMOS** (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic) mostly used nowadays. CMOS circuits account for the majority of circuits nowadays, the basic building blocks of CMOS are the MOS transistors
  - **NMOS** transistors: n-channel MOS transistors
  - **PMOS** transistors: p-channel MOS transistors

## How does a transistor works ?
MOS transistors have 3 terminals, the **gate** (not to confuse with logic gates) is the **controlling** node, the **source** is electrically charged and the **drain** is not, powering the **gate**
allows current to flow from the **source** to the **drain**. \
The conduction between drain and source is either very high (ON) or very low (OFF) and is controlled by the power passed to the gate.
for an NMOS transistor :
- _V_<sub>G</sub> - _V_<sub>S</sub> > _V_<sub>t</sub> &rarr; switch is closed.
- _V_<sub>G</sub> - _V_<sub>S</sub> &lt; _V_<sub>t</sub> &rarr; switch is open. 

We can model logic variables with transistors
- For **NMOS** transistors: S is connected to a low voltage D connected to high voltage, G is connected to input &rarr; X, a logic variable.
  - The switch is closed if X = 1
  - The switch is open if X = 0

- For **PMOS** transistors, it's the oppposite, S connected to high voltage, D connected to low voltage, G connected to input signal &rarr; X, a logic variable.
  - The switch is closed if X = 0
  - The switch is open if X = 1

## What are the inverter, NAND and NOR transistor circuits
The inverter circuit is the following, 
- Q2 is active when the input is low, meaning the current from VDD will pass and return 1 when input is 0.
- Q1 is active when the input is high and discards the signal, the current from VDD cannot pass since Q2 is inactive.

The NAND gate circuit is the following:
- If A is low and B is high (and symmetrically B low A high), Q2 or Q4 are on meaning Z will receive high current from VDD.
- If both A and B are high, Q1 and Q3 will enable and discard VDD, meaning Z will be low.
- If both A and B are low, Q2 and Q4 are on and Z will receive high from VDD.

The NOR gate circuit is the following:
- If A is high and B low (and symmetrically B high A low), Q1 or Q2 will be closed and VDD cannot pass meaning Z is low
- If Both A and B are low, VDD can pass and can only go to Z.

## What means fan-in and fan-out ?
The **fan-in** of a design is the maximum number of inputs that a gate can have in a certain logic family, the number of inputs may limit the speed of the circuit so it is sometimes necessary to impose a certain fan-in. 

We can extend the CMOS gates to gates with more than 2 inputs by simply extanding the design stated previously, A k-input gate has k series and k parallel transistors.
The fan in is deduced by the cumulative ON resistance on the series transistors.

The **fan-out** is the number of gate inputs a gate can **drive**, it is obtained by adding the contribution of all driven logic gates.

## What is CMOS static electrical behavior ? what is ESD ?
Static behavior cover situations where the inputs and outputs are not changing.
### ESD (electrostatic discharge)
ESD can occur when a build up of charge arcs through a dielectric to another surface of opposite charge. For MOS transistors, the dielectric is the insulation between the gates and the channel between the source and the drain.
ICs are protected with ESD protection circuits at their inputs.
## Transition time of CMOS gates
The transistion time is the time it takes to a logic circuit to change from one state to another we distinguish the **rise** time and the **fall** time.
The rise and fall time are strongly affected by
- The ON resistance of the transistors connected in the charge/discharge path
- The load capacitance
